Version 1.4, 2011-10-11

* Symbol aliases

The `--symbol' option has been extended to allow for defining
symbol aliases.  Aliases are useful for declaring reserved
words such as `__restrict' or `__inline'.  For example,
the option `--symbol __restrict:=restrict' instructs cflow
to treat `__restrict' exactly as `restrict'.

* New syntactic class: qualifiers

Tokens in this class can legitimately appear in place
of C qualifiers, such as `static' or `inline'.  This class
is useful for some compiler-depending keywords, such as
`__extension__' in gcc.  The usual declaration of this symbol
is `--symbol __extension__:qualifier'.

* Speed up recursive call detection.

* Fix parsing of typedefs after `struct'.
* Fix the output of branch marks in tree mode.
* Fix processing of static inline functions (RH bug 650716).
